Do you know what makes
this world go 'round?
Around
Do you know what makes
this world go 'round?
Around
Think it through
What it means to you
And everything you do
Don't affect just you, oh
I can't help but feel like
I don't give a fuck
I just take this shit
and blow it up
It's no wonder I feel stuck
Fuck what's said,
you ain't what you claim
We all come from a sin
And I don't know if it'll change
Do you know what makes
this world go 'round?
Around
Do you know what makes
this world go 'round?
Around
